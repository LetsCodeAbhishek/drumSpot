            <h1>Drum kit Intro üé∂</h1>
            <p>A drum kit (also called a drum set,[a] trap set, or simply drums) is a collection of drums, cymbals, and sometimes other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person.[1] The player (drummer) typically holds a pair of matching drumsticks, one in each hand, and uses their feet to operate a foot-controlled hi-hat and bass drum pedal.

                A standard kit may contain:[2]
                
                A snare drum, mounted on a stand
                A bass drum, played with a beater moved by a foot-operated pedal
                One or more tom-toms, including rack toms and/or floor toms
                One or more cymbals, including a ride cymbal and crash cymbal
                Hi-hat cymbals, a pair of cymbals that can be manipulated by a foot-operated pedal
                The drum kit is a part of the standard rhythm section and is used in many types of popular and traditional music styles, ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Before the development of the drum set, drums and cymbals used in military and orchestral music settings were played separately by different percussionists. In the 1840s, percussionists began to experiment with foot pedals as a way to enable them to play more than one instrument, but these devices would not be mass-produced for another 75 years.[3] By the 1860s, percussionists started combining multiple drums into a set. The bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, and other percussion instruments were all struck with hand-held drumsticks. Drummers in musical theater shows and stage shows, where the budget for pit orchestras was often limited, contributed to the creation of the drum set by developing techniques and devices that would enable them to cover the roles of multiple percussionists.

                Double-drumming was developed to enable one person to play the bass and snare with sticks, while the cymbals could be played by tapping the foot on a "low-boy". With this approach, the bass drum was usually played on beats one and three (in 4
                4 time). While the music was first designed to accompany marching soldiers, this simple and straightforward drumming approach led to the birth of ragtime music when the simplistic marching beats became more syncopated. This resulted in a greater swing and dance feel. The drum set was initially referred to as a "trap set", and from the late 1800s to the 1930s, drummers were referred to as "trap drummers". By the 1870s, drummers were using an "overhang pedal".[4] Most drummers in the 1870s preferred to do double-drumming without any pedal to play multiple drums, rather than use an overhang pedal. Companies patented their pedal systems such as that of drummer Edward "Dee Dee" Chandler of New Orleans 1904‚Äì05.[5] This led to the bass drum played by the foot of a standing percussionist (thus the term "kick drum").
                
                William F. Ludwig, Sr., and his brother, Theobald Ludwig, founded Ludwig & Ludwig Co. in 1909 and patented the first commercially successful bass drum pedal system, paving the way for the modern drum kit.[6]
                
                Soon it became apparent that the drum's sound overpowered other instruments on stage. In 1912, drummers replaced sticks with wire brushes, and later, metal fly swatters. Drummers could still play the rudimentary snare figures and grooves with brushes that they would normally play with drumsticks.</p>

            <h2>Playing</h2>
            <p> <b>Grooves</b> <br>
                Kit drumming, whether playing accompaniment of voices and other instruments or doing a drum solo, consists of two elements:
                
                A groove which sets the basic time-feel and provides a rhythmic framework for the song (examples include a backbeat or shuffle).
                Drum fills and other ornaments and variations which provide variety and add interest to the drum sound. Fills could include a sting at the end of a musical section or act as a drum showpiece.
                <br>
                <b>Fills</b><br>
                A fill is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill can be used to "fill in" the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus.[12] Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare, to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic drum solos. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in preparing and indicating significant changes of sections in songs and linking sections. A vocal cue is a short drum fill that introduces a vocal entry. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a chorus or verse.
                <br>
                <b>Drum solos</b><br>
                A drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the drums.[13] While other instrument solos are typically accompanied by the other rhythm section instruments (e.g., bass guitar and electric guitar), for most drum solos, the other band members stop playing so that all of the focus will be on the drummer. In some drum solos, the other rhythm section instrumentalists may play "punches" at certain points ‚Äì sudden, loud chords of a short duration.[14] Drum solos are common in jazz, but they are also used in several rock genres, such as heavy metal and progressive rock. During drum solos, drummers have a degree of creative freedom that allows them to employ complex polyrhythms that would otherwise be unsuitable with an ensemble. In live concerts, drummers may be given extended drum solos, even in genres where drum solos are rare on singles.[15]</p>

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p><b>Drums</b><br> 
                <b>Bass drum</b><br>
                The bass drum (also known as the "kick drum") is the lowest-pitched drum and usually provides the beat or timing element with basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use two or more bass drums or use a double bass drum pedal on a single bass drum. Using a double bass drum pedal enables a drummer to play a double bass drum style with only one bass drum, saving space in recording/performance areas and reducing time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation. Double bass drumming is a technique used in certain genres, including heavy metal and progressive rock.[17]
                <br><b>Snare Drum</b><br>
                The snare drum provides the backbeat. When applied in this fashion, it supplies strong regular accents played by the non-dominant hand, and is the backbone for many fills. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the bed of stiff metal wires held under tension against the bottom head (known as the snare head). When the top head (known as the batter head) is struck with a drumstick, the snare wires, held under tension, vibrate, creating a snappy, staccato buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the batter head.
                <br><b>Toms</b><br> Tom-tom drums, or toms for short, are drums without snares and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires) and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.
<br>
                They include: <br>
                
                Traditional double-headed rack toms, of varying diameters and depths
                Floor toms (generally the widest and largest toms, which also makes them the lowest-pitched toms)
                Single-headed concert toms
                Rototoms
                The smallest and largest drums without snares, octobans and gong drums respectively, are sometimes considered toms. The naming of common configurations (four-piece, five-piece, etc.) is largely a reflection of the number of toms, as only the drums are conventionally counted, and these configurations all contain one snare and one or more bass drums, (though not regularly any standardized use of two bass/kick drums) the balance usually being in toms.
            
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p> <b>Others Drum</b><br>
                Octobans are smaller toms designed for use in a drum kit, extending the tom range upwards in pitch, primarily by their depth and diameter. They are also called rocket toms and tube toms.

Timbales are tuned much higher than a tom of the same diameter, typical use drum shells made of metal, and are normally played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. Timbales are more common in Latin music. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than a tom but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms.
Timbales were also used on occasion by Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham.

Attack timbales and mini timbales are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae & numerous world music styles.

Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20‚Äì24 inches in diameter) but is played with sticks rather than a foot-operated pedal and therefore has the same purpose as that of a floor tom.

Similarly, most hand drum percussion cannot be played easily or suitably with drumsticks without risking damage to the head and to the bearing edge, which is not protected by a metal drum rim, like a snare or tom. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a metal drum head and played with care, or played by hand.
              <br><b>Cymbals</b><br>
              In most drum kits and drum/percussion kits cymbals are as prominent as the drums themselves. The oldest idiophones in music are cymbals, and were used throughout the ancient Near East, very early in the Bronze Age period. Cymbals are most associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship, where Zildjian has predominantly made them since 1623.[18]

While most drummers purchase cymbals individually, beginner cymbal packs were brought to market to provide entry-level cymbals for the novice drummer. The kits normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. Some contain only three cymbals, using a crash/ride instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes closely follow those given in Common configurations below.

Most drummers extend this by adding another crash, a splash, and/or a china/effects cymbal.

            <p> <h2>Other acoustic instruments</h2><br>
                Other instruments that have regularly been incorporated into drum kits include:

Wood block and cowbell, especially in classic rock and other genres
Tambourine, particularly mounted on the hi-hat stand above the cymbals; an ordinary tambourine can be used, or a tambourine produced specially for drum kit use
Timbales can be used to extend the range of tom-toms, particularly when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional timbale is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal
Keyboard percussion instruments such a tubular bells or glockenspiel
Gongs
Triangles
Found objects, including spanners, brake drums, buckets, cardboard boxes, washboards, and jam and kerosene tins (anything ordinary that can be percussively struck to produce sounds, patterns and grooves for their setting)
See also Extended kits below.
<br>            <b>Electronic drums</b> <br>
Electronic drums are used for many reasons. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues such as coffeehouses or church services, where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since fully electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound (apart from the quiet sound of the stick hitting the sensor pads), all of the drum sounds come from a keyboard amplifier or PA system; as such, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some use electronic drums as practice instruments, because they can be listened to with headphones, enabling a drummer to practice without disturbing others. 
  <br><b>Virtual drums</b> <br>
  Virtual drums are a type of audio software that simulates the sound of a drum kit using synthesized drum kit sounds or digital samples of acoustic drum sounds. Different drum software products offer a recording function, the ability to select from several acoustically distinctive drum kits (e.g., jazz, rock, metal), as well as the option to incorporate different songs into the session. Some computer software can turn any hard surface into a virtual drum kit using only one microphone.
